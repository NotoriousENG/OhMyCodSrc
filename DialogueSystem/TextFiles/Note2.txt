[NAME=J. Marlin] Hm ... another note, let's read it . . .

[NAME=Note] "Captains Log: Day F (for Respect)"

"I'm at the end of the line, I've made my last cast only to be shelled raw and left to rot."

"I didn't have it . . . the ultimate weapon"

"Perhaps if I slayed 1,000,000,000 crabs, I'd have enough chiten to create it, the ultimate weapon"

"I only had the patience to slay 999,999,324"

"Beware the Gloctapus"

"It is your... "

** Multiple choice ** (Needs work)

But you'd probably still want everything in the same file right?

[CHOICE=Y] YES
[CHOICE=N] NO

{Y} Well you're in luck, that's what we're doing here!

{N} Ah, well you can really do a number of things, but I'll tell you my way.

You need 2 things really.

1) You need a way to mark choices.
2) You need a way to mark the next line of dialogue to say.

With these you could probably make a system to handle elementary branching dialouge.

Too much branching dialogue could be a headache for this system, if you think this is necessary for your game, you'll definitely want to develop a more modular system..
