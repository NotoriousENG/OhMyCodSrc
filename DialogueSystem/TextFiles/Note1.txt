[NAME=J. Marlin]It looks like a note!

I see some text! Some of it is legible!

[NAME=Note]"Captains Log: Day 3701"

"I can't live off of pineapples anymore, my sanity is at it's limits."

"These crabby henchmen have hoarded my ship parts for too long."

"On top of that 5 of my SOS rocks have been scatteered across the island"

"I leave tomorrow to fight against the Gloctapus, scoundrel of the sea."

"I'll get my ship parts back no matter what!"

"Ye who read this, I leave you with these words:"

"It's dangerous to go alone ... take these mighty weapons!"

[NAME=J. Marlin]Haha how about no!

** Multiple choice ** (Needs work)

But you'd probably still want everything in the same file right?

[CHOICE=Y] YES
[CHOICE=N] NO

{Y} Well you're in luck, that's what we're doing here!

{N} Ah, well you can really do a number of things, but I'll tell you my way.

You need 2 things really.

1) You need a way to mark choices.
2) You need a way to mark the next line of dialogue to say.

With these you could probably make a system to handle elementary branching dialouge.

Too much branching dialogue could be a headache for this system, if you think this is necessary for your game, you'll definitely want to develop a more modular system..
